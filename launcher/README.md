# Lernwelt

A single home screen where a child picks a learning app. It currently has two apps,
**Uhr lesen** (reading a clock) and **Einmaleins** (multiplication).
No ads, no accounts, works offline. All UI text is in German.

It is a plain web app built from ES modules, with no build step and no dependencies,
and it installs as a PWA that opens full screen on a tablet.

## Running it

```bash
cd launcher
npm start          # http://localhost:8080/  (node tools/serve.mjs)
npm test           # unit tests (node --test)
```

Any static web server works, including GitHub Pages in a sub-path, because all paths are relative.
For the service worker (offline mode and installing) the app has to be served over `https://` or from `localhost`.
To install it on a tablet, open it in Chrome or Safari and choose "Zum Startbildschirm hinzufügen".

## Structure

```
lernwelt/
  index.html, manifest.webmanifest, sw.js   PWA shell + offline cache
  src/
    main.js              boot + router (Home is always the bottom history entry)
    theme.css            shared design: colors, fonts, buttons, number pad, dialogs
    fonts/               Baloo 2 and Andika (woff2, SIL Open Font License), bundled for offline use
    core/                storage, profiles, stars/rewards, session log, app registry,
                         import of progress from the old standalone apps (migrate.js)
    services/            speech (de-DE), sounds, per-app services object
    ui/                  h() DOM helper, icons, number pad, dialogs, form fields, top bar
    screens/             home, app host, collection, parent gate, parent area
  apps/
    index.json           registry: list of app folders
    uhr-lesen/           manifest.json, index.js, time-phrase.js, clock.js, style.css, icon.svg
    einmaleins/          manifest.json, index.js, logic.js, tips.js, style.css, icon.svg
  tests/                 node --test
  tools/                 dev server, icon rendering
```

## Adding a new app

1. Create a folder `apps/<id>/` containing `manifest.json`, `index.js` and an icon.
2. Add `"<id>"` to `apps/index.json`.

You don't have to change any launcher code.

### manifest.json

```json
{
  "id": "einmaleins",
  "name": "Einmaleins",
  "subtitle": "Rechnen mit mal",
  "icon": "icon.svg",
  "color": "#F4A340",
  "order": 2,
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "files": ["style.css", "logic.js", "tips.js"]
}
```

`id` must match the folder name (`a-z`, `0-9`, `-`).
`entry` is optional and defaults to `index.js`.
`files` is also optional: it lists extra files the service worker should cache for offline use at install time.
Modules the entry imports are cached anyway once the launcher has loaded them.

An app's stylesheet should scope every rule under one root class (`.uhr`, `.emx`), because the parent area
loads the stylesheets of several apps at once for their progress cards.

### Design

The launcher and all apps share one look, defined by the `--lw-*` tokens at the top of `src/theme.css`
(it started as the "Uhr lesen" design): a mint ground (`--lw-bg`), flat white cards with a 3px border
(`--lw-border`, `--lw-radius`), the yellow pill for the main action (`--lw-sun`), blue for "selected"
(`--lw-primary`, `--lw-selected`), green for "check" (`--lw-success`) and a gentle orange for mistakes
(`--lw-warning`). Interface text uses Baloo 2 (`--lw-font`), reading text such as phrases, tips and
examples uses Andika (`--lw-reading`). New apps should map their colors to these tokens instead of
defining their own palette, and reuse the same patterns: `.lw-btn--primary` for the main action,
bordered cards that turn blue when selected, a row of stars for progress in a round.

### Entry module

```js
export function mount(container, services) { … }   // required: render the app
export function unmount() { … }                     // required: clean up (timers, listeners, number pad)
export function SettingsScreen(container, services) { … return cleanup? }   // optional, parent area
export function ProgressSummary(container, services) { … return cleanup? }  // optional, progress card
```

The launcher draws the **Home button** (top left) and the top bar itself, so it looks the same in every app.
Each app shows its own reward screen at the end of a round and then calls `services.goHome()`.

### `services`

| Field | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `storage.get(key, fallback)`, `.set`, `.remove`, `.update`, `.keys`, `.clear` | JSON storage under `lernwelt.<appId>.<profileId>.*`. Apps can't reach each other's data. |
| `session.begin()` | Starts a round. While a round is running, Home and the back button ask before leaving. |
| `session.update({correct,total})` | Optional. Lets the launcher still log an interrupted round. |
| `session.end({correct,total,stars?})` | Logs `{appId, date, duration, correct, total}` and adds the stars to the shared total (1–5 by default, see `ui.starsForRound`). |
| `stars.total()`, `stars.forApp()` | Current star counts. |
| `speech.speak(text)`, `.stop()`, `.available` | German text-to-speech (Web Speech API, `de-DE`). |
| `sounds.correct()`, `.wrong()`, `.reward()`, `.tap()` | Shared sounds, synthesized with Web Audio. |
| `ui.h`, `ui.icon`, `ui.createNumpad`, `ui.confirm`, `ui.starsRow`, `ui.switchField`, `ui.selectField`, `ui.chipsField`, `ui.loadStylesheet` | Shared UI building blocks, styled by `theme.css`. |
| `asset(path)` | URL of a file inside the app folder. |
| `profile` | `{ id, name, avatar }` of the child. |
| `log.list()` | This app's past sessions. |
| `goHome()` | Back to the home screen. |

## Behavior

- **Home:** shows "Hallo [Name]!", the star total, and a tile per visible app with an icon, name, subtitle, star counter, a "Heute geübt" badge, and a speaker button that reads the name aloud. The grid has 2, 3 or 4 columns depending on screen width.
- **Navigation:** the browser or Android back button always returns to Home. During a running round the child is asked "Wirklich aufhören?" first. After a reload the app always starts on Home.
- **Parent gate:** a question like 14 × 7, which is well outside the 1×1 range.
- **Parent area:** name and avatar; show or hide apps; per-app settings (Uhr: Stufe, regional forms, speech rate; Einmaleins: help level, time limit for "Keine Hilfe"); one progress card per app (Uhr: which kinds of times go wrong, types of mistakes, last rounds; Einmaleins: 10×10 grid of Leitner boxes); daily time limit (off by default; a running round is still finished); sound and speech switches; reset progress per app. Resetting keeps the shared star total and the unlocked rewards.
- **Rewards:** every 20 stars unlocks a figure, a background or a sticker ("Meine Sammlung", reached by tapping the star counter or the avatar). There is no shop and nothing to spend.

## Data layout (ready for more child profiles)

```
lernwelt._launcher.profiles              [{ id: "p1", name, avatar, background }]
lernwelt._launcher.activeProfile
lernwelt._launcher.<profileId>.stars     { total, byApp }
lernwelt._launcher.<profileId>.sessions  [{ appId, profileId, date, day, duration, correct, total, stars, completed }]
lernwelt._launcher.<profileId>.usage     { "YYYY-MM-DD": { appId: seconds } }
lernwelt._launcher.<profileId>.settings  { sound, speech, timeLimitEnabled, timeLimitMinutes }
lernwelt._launcher.legacy.<key>          backup of progress imported from the old standalone apps
lernwelt.<appId>.<profileId>.*           app data (both apps keep everything in one "data" entry)
```

Adding a second child only needs a profile picker. The data model already supports it.

## Updating

If you change files under `src/`, bump `VERSION` in `sw.js` and add any new file to `CORE`.
A test catches files that are missing from `CORE`.
To regenerate the PNG icons from the SVGs, run `node tools/make-icons.mjs`, which needs Playwright.
